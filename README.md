## `WCS - Quest- Asynchronous requests with Fetch and Axios`

---

Wild Code School quest with JavaScript - AJAX

#### *Goal:*
The API https://api.chucknorris.io/ will provide you with everything you need to impress your friends, by introducing them to your own Chuck Norris Facts application. 
It will generate randomly obtained quotes.

You can adapt the last example of axios to query this API.

Download this template, and save it in a new folder.

Initialise a Git repo in the new folder, and create a repository on GitHub (e.g. chuck-norris-facts).

Retrieve example code using axios with the Pok√©mon API

Adapt the code to call the right URL (API "Use" section)generate the HTML containing Chuck's avatar and text, from the recovered objectdisplay the HTML block in the appropriate div.

Commit and push

In the "Settings" tab of your GitHub repo, activate GitHub Pages on the master branch.

If you wish to challenge yourself, you can add a button with a click event allowing a new quote to load on a page instead of having to reload the page (take a look at this resource on  how to manage a click)

Post the URL of the page on GitHub Pages and submit it as your solution.


#### *Validation criteria:*

1. The page is accessible via GitHub pages

2. A quote from Chuck Norris appears, with the avatar and text
